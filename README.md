# Analyzing-agricultural-productivity-across-indian-states

Week 1

Project Overview

This Power BI project aims to visualize and analyze agricultural productivity across Indian states using data-driven insights. Week 1 focuses on setting up the environment, importing the dataset, and preparing the groundwork for future analytics and dashboards.

Week 1 Objectives

Upload and verify the agricultural productivity dataset in Power BI.

Understand dataset structure and metadata.

Prepare data for future transformations and visualizations.


Dataset Details

Filename: crop_details.csv

Source: Provided as part of the project
Key Columns:

State_Name – Name of the Indian state

District_Name – District-level granularity

Crop_Year – Year of production

Season – Crop season (e.g., Kharif, Rabi)

Crop – Name of the crop

Area – Cultivated area in hectares

Production – Crop production in tonnes


Steps Completed

1. Created Power BI File

File: analyzing agricultural productivity week 1 task.pbix



2. Imported Dataset

Navigated to Home > Get Data > Text/CSV

Selected crop_details.csv

Verified column types and headers

Loaded data into Power BI model



3. Initial Exploration

Checked for nulls and inconsistencies

Confirmed data types: numeric fields (Area, Production) and categorical fields (State_Name, Crop, etc.)

No transformations applied in this stage; raw data loaded for analysis in future weeks

Tools Used

Power BI Desktop (PBIX)

CSV Dataset


Next Steps

Perform data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor.

Add calculated columns (e.g., yield per hectare).

Begin designing key visualizations: state-wise yield, crop trends, seasonal productivity.
